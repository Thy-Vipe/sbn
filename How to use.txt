This script is for Maya 2014 and newer (it uses PySide, which may not be included in Maya 2013)
For WINDOWS users. 


1) Install the script in C:\C:\Users\%YOU%\Documents\maya\scripts
2) Execute the command below via the script editor/the command line set to Python, 
   or via a a new shelf button** (see bottom):

from searchByName import sbnSys
reload(sbnSys)
sbn = sbnSys.sbnWidget()
sbn.show()

########################################################################################
TIP: After having sbn opened, hit F1 while focusing sbn's window to see all the hotkeys.
     Typing "@all" in one of the Research term will make the script list any item that matches the filters.
     Excluding stuff while using @all still works.In that case it'll list everything excepted the objects containing the excluded terms.

You can hit:

	CTRL+F to enable/disable advanced filtering. [Default is Disabled]
	S to enable/disable shapes. [Default is Disabled]
	Z to enable/disable the querying of everything, includes systemNodes (filters, etc...). [Default is Disabled]
 	M to enable/disable the Capital letters mode (to ignore upper and lower cases). [Default is Disabled]
 	F2 to enable/disable the keyTracking, which allows to find items that has their first letter matching with the one hit on the keyboard. [Default is Disabled]
	Space key while focusing the results list widget to deselect all (also works with double click if it is on an item).
	Shift modifier while focusing the results list widget to select from a point to an other.
	CTRL+A while focusing the results list widget to select all objects listed in it.
	
	U to enable/disable UI update according to what is selected on the scene. [Default is Enabled excepted with a huge list]
	CTRL+U to enable/disable updating for updating even in huge selection mode (might slow down Maya, default is Disabled, and when disabled, the window only updates when getting focus). [Default is Disabled]

	NOTE: Holding ALT while using keyTracking mode (F2) will add the new object to current selection.
	In keyTracking mode: Up Arrow and Down Arrow + letters

**To create a new shelf button, copy paste this as MEL code in the command line: shelfEditorDialog;

Choose the shelf you prefer, or create a new one (by clicking the little white paper with some kind
of "star" just under "Shelves").

Create a new shelf content, again by clicking the little white paper with some kind of "star" just under
"Shelf Contents", name it the way you want and add the tooltip and icon you want. You can also use
the icon given with the script if you wish to.
 
Select your new shelf content, and then go to the "Command" tab (in the upper part of the Shelf Editor's window), 
choose the language Python and paste the command given above this tip (from searchByName [...])
